# TODOs

Daily TODOs in my preferred style: separate lists for each day of the week and custom made lists. I used to fill a page of a notebook each day writing and crossing out completed items, completed days, etc. This works much better in an App: days automatically update, no need to re-write items that weren't completed on a given day, etc. I'm also using much less paper than I was with a notebook :recycle:
