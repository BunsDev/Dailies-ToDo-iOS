# TODOs

Daily TODOs in my preferred style: separate lists for each day of the week plus custom made lists. I used to fill a page of a notebook each day writing and crossing out completed items, completed days, etc. This works much better in an App: days automatically update, no need to re-write items that weren't completed on a given day, and much more. I'm also using much less paper than I was with a notebook. I miss the doodles though.

Please feel free to clone/copy/use any of the code in this project, just don't upload this straight to the App Store! Not planning on doing that here, this is just for personal use.
